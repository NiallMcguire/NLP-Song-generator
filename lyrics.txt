I'm not a rat to be spat on locked up in this room 
Those bars that look towards the sun at night look towards the moon
Everyday the swallows play in the clouds of love
Make me wish that I had wings take me high above
And I looked high and saw the empty sky
If I could only, I could only fly
I'd drift with them in endless space
But no man flies from this place
At night I lay upon my bench and stare towards the stars
The cold night air comes creeping in and home seems oh so far
If only I could swing upon those twinkling dots above
I'd look down from the heavens upon the ones I love
Hey the lucky locket hangs around your precious neck
Some luck I ever got with you and I wouldn't like to bet
That sooner or later you'll own just one half of this land
By shining your eyes on the wealth of every man
Just send up my love ain't seen nothing but tears
Now I've got myself in this room for years
I don't see no one, I never see anyone
The seadogs have all sailed their ships
Into the docks of dawn
While the sirens sit and comb their hair
And twiddle with their thumbs
Oh Thor above the mountain
Look down upon your children
This is their heaven where they're told
To bring their galleons
Seek you find your place with me
Men of iron, men of steel
Only the brave hear the hammers ring
In the courts of the Queens, in the halls of the Kings
You can come to Val-hala in your own time
Come to Val-hala seek and you will find Val-hala
Come to Val-hala in your own time
Come to Val-hala seek and you will find Val-hala
There's long boats in the harbor
Which arrive there every hour
With the souls of the heroes
Whose blood lies on the flowers
And this heaven is the home
Of every man who loves his sword
And he uses it for freedom
To preach the word of Thor
It's hard to feel what's in your head
Where the gas lamps grow
And the garbage blows
Around the paper stands
And a baby cried
And I saw a light
And I wondered where
And I wondered why
There'd be a loss of life
Down here tonight
Down on Western Ford Gateway
That's a place where the dead say
That a man lives no more
That his fair share of days
Down on Western Ford Gateway
It flowed upon the cobbled floor
For the bottle's dead
And they're drunk again
By the tavern door
She chose the soft center
And took it to bed with her mother
And the ideal confusion
Was just an illusion
To gain further news of her brother
And the comfort of mother
Was just an appeal for protection
For the cat from next door
Was found later at four
In surgical dissection
And I don't want to be
The son of any freak
Who for a chocolate center
Can take you off the street
For soon they'll plough the desert
And God knows where I'll be
Collecting submarine numbers
On the main street of the sea
The Vicar is thicker
And I just can't see through to him
For his cardinal sings
A collection of hymns
And a collection of coins is made after
And who wrote the Bible
Was it Judas or Pilate
Well one cleans his hands
While the other one hangs
But still I continue to stand
Look up little brother
Can you see the clover
No not over there
A little bit left and over there
Now look and see the lilac tree
The lily pond, the skylark's song
The open air but no one cares
If branches live and die out there
Remember when you were nine
And I was ten
We would run into the woods
No we never will again
And Lady, what's tomorrow
What's tomorrow anyway
If it's not the same as now
It's the same as yesterday
Yes Lady, what's tomorrow
Will it be the same as now
Will the farmer push the pen
Will the writer pull the plough
Look up little brother
Can you see the clover
Oh sorry but it's over
Now there's concrete and no clover
I viewed in my presence
My hand on my forehead
And sighting the liners
Of mad merchant seamen
In search of the living
Or the spices of China
Lucy walked gently
Between the damp barrels
And shut out my eyes
With the width of her fingers
Said she'd guessed the number
Of bales in the back room
While the seagulls were screaming
Lucy was eating
Then we hauled up our colors
The way the mother had told us
And together we just watched the sails
Lucy I said
In a passage of cotton kegs
Can we hold hands
I'm sure that it's warmer
Then the gulls ate the crumbs
Of Lucy's sandwich
In Orient where wise I was
To please the way I live
Come give the beggar chance at hand
His life is on his lip
Three score a thousand times
Where once in Amazon
Where Eldorado holds the key
No keeper holds my hand
Unchain the gate of solitude
The ruler says you run
Run hard unto the scaffold high
Your chance to jump the gun
Oh how high the scaffold grows
The plant life of your widow
In black lace curtains brought you near
From out the plate glass window
The Minotaur with bloody hands
Is enraged by the sun
Caged he by the corpses
Brought forth by the dawn
In Orient is as I told
The buckshee hangman swears
For open crypts to silence
Nylon knots to sway by prayer
In Orient where wise I was
To please the way I live
Come give the beggar chance at hand
His life is on his lip
Turn me loose from your hands
Let me fly to distant lands
Over green fields, trees and mountains
Flowers and forest fountains
Home along the lanes of the skyway
For this dark and lonely room
Projects a shadow cast in gloom
And my eyes are mirrors
Of the world outside
Thinking of the way
That the wind can turn the tide
And these shadows turn
From purple into grey
For just a Skyline Pigeon
Dreaming of the open
Waiting for the day
He can spread his wings
And fly away again
Fly away skyline pigeon fly
Towards the dreams
You've left so very far behind
Just let me wake up in the morning
To the smell of new mown hay
To laugh and cry, to live and die
In the brightness of my day
I want to hear the pealing bells
Of distant churches sing
But most of all please free me
From this aching metal ring
And open out this cage towards the sun
Gulliver's gone to the final command of his master
His watery eyes had washed all the hills with his laughter
And the seasons can change all the light from the grey to the dim
But the light in his eyes will see no more bright
As the sheep that he locked in the pen
There's four feet of ground in front of the barn
That's sun baked and rain soaked and part of the farm
But now it lies empty so cold and so bare
Gulliver's gone but his memory lies there
By passing the doors of his life was a stage I remember
And in later years he would cease to bare teeth to a stranger
For sentiment touched him as Cyclamen holds him
And later men came from the town
Who said clear the child this won't take a while
And Gulliver's gone with the dawn
When the shrill winds are screaming
And the evening is still
Lady Samantha glides over the hills
In a long satin dress that she wears every day
Her home is the hillside, her bed is the grave
Lady Samantha glides like a tiger
Over the hills with no one beside her
No one comes near
They all live in fear
But Lady Samantha, she sheds only tears
Lady Samantha glides like a tiger
Over the hills with no one beside her
No one comes near
They all live in fear
But Lady Samantha, she sheds only tears
The tales that I told round the fire every night
Are out of proportion and none of them right
She is harmless and empty of anything bad
For she once had something that most of you have
Lady Samantha glides like a tiger
Over the hills with no one beside her
No one comes near
They all live in fear
But Lady Samantha, she sheds only tears
Lady Samantha glides like a tiger
Over the hills with no one beside her
No one comes near
They all live in fear
But Lady Samantha, she sheds only tears
The sister of sunlight
Comes to my lonely life
Bearin' the crosses I hung
I hung on my lonely wife
And the anchor told me
If I prayed by the river
That the sweet sound of water
Would always go with her
All across the havens
To the waterfall
They told me I would meet her there
Inside those icy walls
But how on earth in this universe
Can they forgive me of my pains?
For all across the havens
I must stumble, locked in chains
Then the mother of mercy
Showed me her stable
And told me you would be safe
Safe in her cradle
And the waterfall opened
And the water withdrew
Leavin' me standing
On a road leading through
All across the havens
To the waterfall
They told me that I would meet her there
Inside those icy walls
But how on earth in this universe
Can they forgive me of my pains?
For all across the havens
I must stumble, locked in chains
Hey there
Look in the mirror
Are you afraid you might see me looking at you
Waiting, waiting at windows
Oh, it's me that you need
Yes, it's me and I'm waiting for you
But I remain silent
Oh, I won't say a word
I leave you to realise I'm the light in your world
And it's me, yes it's me, yes it's me, yes it's me
That you're needing
It's me, yes it's me, yes it's me, yes it's me
That you need
Yes, it's me, yes it's me, yes it's me
If you want to be living
I'm the one who's forgiving
Admit that it's me that you need
Watching, watching the swallows fly
It all means the same
Just like them
You can fly home again
But don't, no don't forget yesterday
Pride is an ugly word girl
And you still know my name
But I remain silent
Oh, I won't say a word
I leave you to realise I'm the light in your world
And it's me, yes it's me, yes it's me, yes it's me
That you're needing
It's me, yes it's me, yes it's me, yes it's me
That you need
Yes, it's me, yes it's me, yes it's me
If you want to be living
I'm the one who's forgiving
Admit that it's me that you need
I looked up from my glass into the sky
There's no one in my comic book to buy
Calendar swung on the wall held by a rusty nail
Down came the strange rain and washed my thoughts away
So stop in the sky and tell me why
You're changing your colours before my eyes
Yellow, blue, green and grey
Settled on the window pane
So stop in the sky and tell me why
You're changing your colours before my eyes
Yellow, blue, green and grey
Settled on the window pane
It made the rain that came seem strange
Just like strange rain
It made the rain that came seem strange
Just like strange rain
Still I sit beside the fire and watched as it fell
Come in colours from above into my citadel
My eyes are all embroidered with the rainbow you have made
And now it seems as though it's just, just like strange rain
So stop in the sky and tell me why
You're changing your colours before my eyes
Yellow, blue, green and grey
Settled on the window pane
So stop in the sky and tell me why
You're changing your colours before my eyes
Yellow, blue, green and grey
Settled on the window pane
It made the rain that came seem strange
Just like strange rain
It made the rain that came seem strange
Just like strange rain
So stop in the sky and tell me why
You're changing your colours before my eyes
Yellow, blue, green and grey
Settled on the window pane
So stop in the sky and tell me why
You're changing your colours before my eyes
Yellow, blue, green and grey
Settled on the window pane
It made the rain that came seem strange
Just like strange rain
It made the rain that came seem strange
Just like strange rain
It's a little bit funny, this feeling inside
I'm not one of those who can easily hide
I don't have much money, but boy if I did
I'd buy a big house where we both could live
If I was a sculptor, but then again, no
Or a man who makes potions in a traveling show
I know it's not much, but it's the best I can do
My gift is my song, and this one's for you
And you can tell everybody this is your song
It may be quite simple, but now that it's done
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind that I put down in words
How wonderful life is while you're in the world
I sat on the roof and kicked off the moss
Well, a few of the verses, well, they've got me quite cross
But the sun's been quite kind while I wrote this song
It's for people like you that keep it turned on
So excuse me forgetting, but these things I do
You see I've forgotten if they're green or they're blue
Anyway the thing is what I really mean
Yours are the sweetest eyes I've ever seen
And you can tell everybody this is your song
It may be quite simple, but now that it's done
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind that I put down in words
How wonderful life is while you're in the world
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind that I put down in words
How wonderful life is while you're in the world
You're not a ship to carry my life
You are nailed to my love in many lonely nights
I've strayed from the cottages and found myself here
For I need your love your love protects my fears
And I wonder sometimes and I know I'm unkind
But I need you to turn to when I act so blind
And I need you to turn to when I lose control
You're my guardian angel who keeps out the cold
Did you paint your smile on, well I said I knew
That my reason for living was for loving you
We're related in feeling but you're high above
You're pure and you're gentle with the grace of a dove
If you feel that it's real I'm on trial
And I'm here in your prison
Like a coin in your mint
I am dented and I'm spent with high treason
Through a glass eye your throne
Is the one danger zone
Take me to the pilot for control
Take me to the pilot of your soul
Take me to the pilot
Lead me through the chamber
Take me to the pilot
I am but a stranger
Take me to the pilot
Lead me through the chamber
Take me to the pilot
I am but a stranger
Well I know he's not old
And I'm told he's a virgin
For he may be she
But what I'm told is never for certain
Through a glass eye your throne
Is the one danger zone
Take me to the pilot for control
Take me to the pilot of your soul
Take me to the pilot
Lead me through the chamber
Take me to the pilot
I am but a stranger
Take me to the pilot
Lead me through the chamber
Take me to the pilot
I am but a stranger
Through a glass eye your throne
Is the one danger zone
Take me to the pilot for control
Take me to the pilot of your soul
Take me to the pilot
Lead me through the chamber
Take me to the pilot
I am but a stranger
Take me to the pilot
Lead me through the chamber
Take me to the pilot
I am but a stranger
Lady love rides a big red Cadillac
Buys the hoedown show salt and beans
Goes to church to pray for Lucifer
She milked the male population clean
So ride in line shake yourself by the hand
Live your life inside a paper can
But you'll never get to pick and choose
She's bought you and sold you
There ain't no shoestrings on Louise
Come on down, come on down from the ladder
Henry get your head, get your head out of them clouds
What she wants is to go kissing on a swine herd
You might as well kiss the boss man's cow
All those city women want to make us poor men
And this land's got the worse for the worrying
I got married at the early age of fourteen
And I've been worrying about the way you'll be loving them
I was one as you were one
And we were two so much in love forever
I loved the white socks that you wore
But you don't wear white socks no more, now you're a woman
I joked about your turned-up nose
And criticized your school girl clothes
But would I then have paced these roads to love you
For seasons come and seasons go
Bring forth the rain the sun and snow
Make Valerie a woman
And Valerie is lonely
No more to roam on the snow hills of Hienton
Undecided with the guardians of the older generation
A doormat was a sign of welcome
In the winter months to come
And in the summer laughing
Through the castle ruins we'd run
For the quadrangle sang to the sun
And the grace of our feeling
And the candle burned low as we talked of the future
Underneath the ceiling
There were tears in the sky
And the clouds in your eyes were just cover
For your thighs were the cushions
Of my love and yours for each other
The songs still are sung
It was fun to be young
But please don't be sad where `ere you are
I am who I am
You are who you are
Now Valerie's a woman
Now Valerie's a woman
Now Valerie's a woman
Who'll walk me down to church when I'm sixty years of age
When the ragged dog they gave me has been ten years in the grave
And senorita play guitar, play it just for you
My rosary has broken and my beads have all slipped through
You've hung up your great coat and you've laid down your gun
You know the war you fought in wasn't too much fun
And the future you're giving me holds nothing for a gun
I've no wish to be living sixty years on
Yes I'll sit with you and talk let your eyes relive again
I know my vintage prayers would be very much the same
And Magdelena plays the organ, plays it just for you
Your choral lamp that burns so low when you are passing through
And the future you're giving me holds nothing for a gun
I've no wish to be living sixty years on
Holy Moses I have been removed
I have seen the specter he has been here too
Distant cousin from down the line
Brand of people who ain't my kind
Holy Moses I have been removed
Holy Moses I have been deceived
Now the wind has changed direction and I'll have to leave
Won't you please excuse my frankness but it's not my cup of tea
Holy Moses I have been deceived
I'm going back to the border
Where my affairs, my affairs ain't abused
I can't take any more bad water
I've been poisoned from my head down to my shoes
Holy Moses I have been deceived
Holy Moses let us live in peace
Let us strive to find a way to make all hatred cease
There's a man over there what's his color I don't care
He's my brother let us live in peace
He's my brother let us live in peace
He's my brother let us live in peace
Peering out of tiny eyes
The grubby hands that gripped the rail
Wiped the window clean of frost
As the morning air laid on the latch
A whistle awakened someone there
Next door to the nursery just down the hall
A strange new sound you never heard before
A strange new sound that makes boys explore
Tread neat so small those little feet
Amid the morning his small heart beats
So much excitement yesterday
That must be rewarded must be displayed
Large hands lift him through the air
Excited eyes contain him there
The eyes of those he loves and knows
But what's this extra bed just here
His puzzled head tipped to one side
Amazement swims in those bright green eyes
Glancing down upon this thing
That make strange sounds, strange sounds that sing
In those silent happy seconds
That surround the sound of this event
A parent smile is made in moments
They have made for you a friend
And all you ever learned from them
Until you grew much older
Did not compare with when they said
This is your brand new brother
This is your brand new brother
This is your brand new brother
Have you ever lived in a cage
Where you live to be whipped and be tamed
For I've never loved in a cage
Or talked to a friend or just waved
Well I walk while they talk about virtue
Just raised on my back legs and snarled
Watched you kiss your old daddy with passion
And tell dirty jokes as he died
But I'm damned when I really care there
For the cellar's the room in your lives
Where you lace yourself with bad whiskey
And close the cage doors on your life
Well I pray while you bathe in bad water
Sing songs that I learnt as a boy
Then breaks all the bones in my body
On the bars you can never destroy
No man's a jester playing Shakespeare
Round your throne room floor
While the juggler's act is danced upon
The crown that you once wore
And sooner or later
Everybody's kingdom must end
And I'm so afraid your courtiers
Cannot be called best friends
Caesar's had your troubles
Widows had to cry
While mercenaries in cloisters sing
And the king must die
Some men are better staying sailors
Take my word and go
But tell the ostler that his name was
The very first they chose
And if my hands are stained forever
And the altar should refuse me
Would you let me in, would you let me in, would you let me in
Should I cry sanctuary
No man's a jester playing Shakespeare
Round your throne room floor
While the juggler's act is danced upon
The crown that you once wore
The king is dead, the king is dead
The king is dead, the king is dead
Long live the king
It seems as though I've lived my life
On the bad side of the moon
To stir your dregs in sickness still
Without the rustic spoon
Common people live with me
Where the light has never shone
And the hermits flock like hummingbirds
To speak in a foreign tongue
I'm a light world away
From the people who make me stay
Sitting on the bad side of the moon
There ain't no need for watchdogs here
To justify our ways
We live our life in manacles
The main cause of our stay
Exiled here from other worlds
My sentence comes too soon
Why should I be made to pay
On the bad side of the moon
Why's it never light on my lawn
Why does it rain and never say good-day to the new-born
On the big screen they showed us the sun
But not as bright in life as the real one
It's never quite the same as the real one
And tell me grey seal
How does it feel
To be so wise
To see through eyes
That only see what's real
Tell me grey seal
I never learned why meteors were formed
I only farmed in schools that were so warn and torn
If anyone can cry then so can I
I read books and draw life from the eye
All my life is drawings from the eye
Your mission bells were wrought by ancient men
The roots were formed by twisted roots
Your roots were twisted then
I was re-born before all life could die
The Phoenix bird will leave this world to fly
If the Phoenix bird can fly then so can I
If anyone should see me making it down the highway
Breaking all the laws of the land
Well don't you try to stop me
I'm going her way
And that's the way I'm sure she had it planned
Well that's my Rock-and-roll Madonna
She's always been a lady of the road
Well everybody wants her
But no one ever gets her
Well the freeway is the only way she knows
Well if she would only slow down for a short time
I'd get to know her just before she leaves
But she's got some fascination for that two wheel combination
And I swear it's going to be the death of me
Our glorious city
Was build by the divinities by Gods
Who saw fit to bestow
The gift of a paradise
Peaceful and harmonious upon
Us mere mortals below
And made El Dorado
The magnificent and golden
One thousand years ago
El Dorado, El Dorado, El Dorado
But all this was granted
For only one millenium
I know my legacy is to fulfill
My promise to all my people
Who have trusted me, the Gods
Will approve of us still
Preserve El Dorado
The magnificent and golden
And I believe they will
El Dorado, El Dorado, El Dorado
El Dorado, El Dorado, El Dorado
The mountains so high and waters deep
Are her disguise
Her secrets are safe from foreign hands
And eyes forever
Preserve El Dorado
The magnificent and golden
And I believe they will
El Dorado, El Dorado, El Dorado
El Dorado, El Dorado, El Dorado
El Dorado, El Dorado, El Dorado
El Dorado, El Dorado, El Dorado
Someday out of the blue
In a crowded street
Or a deserted square
I'll turn and I'll see you
As if our love were new
Someday we can start again someday soon

Here comes the night
Here come the memories
Lost in your arms
Down in the foreign fields
Not so long ago
Seems like eternity
Those sweet afternoons
Still capture me

Someday out of the blue
In a crowded street
Or a deserted square
I'll turn and I'll see you
As if our love were new
Someday we can start again someday soon
I still believe
I still put faith in us
We had it all
And watched it slip away
Where are we now
Not where we want to be
Those hot afternoons
Still follow me
Someday out of the blue
Maybe years from now
Or tomorrow night
I'll turn and I'll see you
As if we always knew
Someday we would live again someday soon
I still believe
I still put faith in us
I still believe
I still put faith in us
I still believe
I still put faith in us
Here comes the night
Here come the memories
Lost in your arms
Down in the foreign fields
Not so long ago
Seems like eternity
Those sweet afternoons
Still capture me
Someday out of the blue
Maybe years from now
Or tomorrow night
I'll turn and I'll see you
As if we always knew
Someday we would live again someday soon
Someday out of the blue
In a crowded street
Or a deserted square
I'll turn and I'll see you
As if our love were new
Someday we can start again someday soon
I still believe
I still put faith in us
I still believe
I still put faith in us
I still believe
I still put faith in us
I still believe
I still put faith in us
I still believe
I still put faith in us
I still believe
I still put faith in us
The more I learn, the more I see
The less the world impassions me
The hungry heart, the roving eye
Have come to rest, do not apply
The frantic chase, the crazy ride
The thrill has gone, I step aside
And I'd believe in anything were it not for you
Showing me by just existing only this is true
I love you, I love you without question, I love you
The more I want the more I steal
The more I hold the less is real
All worldly things I follow blind
In hope not faith was paid in kind
The line is drawn, the change is made
I come to you, I'm not afraid
And I'd believe in anything were it not for you
Showing me by just existing only this is true
I love you, I love you without question, I love you
I'd believe in anything were it not for you
Showing me by just existing only this is true
I love you, I love you without question, I love you
There isn't much I haven't shared
With you along the road
And through it all there'd always be
Tomorrow's episode
Suddenly that isn't true
There's another avenue
Beckoning, the great divide
Ask no questions, take no side
Who's to say who's right or wrong
Whose course is braver run
Still we are, have always been, will ever be as one
What is done hath been done for the best
Though the mist in my eyes might suggest
Just a little confusion about what I'll lose
But if I started over I know I would choose
The same joy the same sadness each step of the way
That fought me and tought me that friends never say
Never say goodbye
Never say goodbye
Never say goodbye
Never say goodbye
Suddenly that isn't true
There's another avenue
Beckoning, the great divide
I would choose
The same joy the same sadness each step of the way
That fought me and taught me that friends never say
Never say goodbye
Never say goodbye
Never say goodbye
Never say goodbye
Look out new world here we come
Brave, intrepid and then some
Pioneers of maximum
Audacity whose resumes
Show that we are just the team
To live where others merely dream
Building up a head of steam
On the trail we blaze
Changing legend into fact
We shall ride into history
Turning myth into truth
We shall surely gaze
On the sweet unfolding
Of an antique mystery
All will be revealed
On the trail we blaze
Paradise is close at hand
Shangri-la the promised land
Seventh heaven on demand
Quite unusual nowadays
Virgin vistas, undefiled
Minds and bodies running wild
In the man behold the child
On the trail we blaze
The trail we blaze
Is a road uncharted
Through terra incognita to a golden shrine
No place for the traveler
To be faint-hearted
We are part of the sumptuous grand design
Shangri-la the promised land
Seventh heaven on demand
Quite unusual nowadays
Virgin vistas, undefiled
Minds and bodies running wild
In the man behold the child
On the trail we blaze
Changing legend into fact
We shall ride into history
Turning myth into truth
We shall surely gaze on the sweet unfolding
Of an antique mystery
All will be revealed
On the trail we blaze
On the trail we blaze
Oh it's great to see our homeland
Breathe the Iberian atmosphere
Just because we are Hispanic
Doesn't mean we're oceanic
Quite frankly we've had water up to here
We've nade waves to last a lifetime
We've been saturated, almost drowned
We are Spanish not Caribbean
We are human, not amphibian
We'll seek our fortunes on Spain's solid ground
There's no future in the new world
Only fools believe the tales
Of the gold of El Dorado
Only suckers set their sails
We have seen the way the tide is turning
We see what no sailor can
We are in the ball, discerning
We're anit-diluvian
Sixteenth century man
Two very fine examples of
Sixteenth, sixteenth century man
There are women who are lining
Every avenue in every port
Now at last we'll get to grips with
Things they never equip ships with
We have sailed into our last resort
There's no goldmine in the new world
It's a trick to get recruits
On the boat to El Dorado
We're returning to our roots
We're going back to land locked ladies
Cortez never let them board
All in all the point we've made is
We don't want to go abroad
two very fine examples of
Sixteenth century man
Two terra firma samples of
Sixteenth, sixteenth century man
Often these days
And always these nights
I find I'm afraid
Of the turbulent heights
No matter how crazily
No matter how far
The moments of tenderness
Are those where you are
For when you are laughing
Like silver, like rain
You cool me, you soothe me
And love me again
For a few perfect hours
The world lets me be
You know how to calm down
Oh oh
The panic in me
The panic in me
The panic in me
The panic in me
Once in a while
I slip back to my past
Where I long to remain
But the dream does not last
In the trials of the present
No matter how low
You bring me such peace
And you won't let me go
For when you are laughing
Like silver, like rain
You cool me, you soothe me
And love me again
For a few perfect hours
The world lets me be
You know how to break down
Oh oh
The panic in me
The panic in me
The panic in me
The panic in me
In the trials of the present
No matter how low
You bring me such peace
And you won't let me go
Oh don't let me go
For when you are laughing
Lile silver, like rain
You cool me, you soothe me
And you love me again
For a few perfect hours
The world lets me be
You know how to break down
Oh oh, oh oh
The panic in me
The panic in me
The panic in me
The panic in me
The panic in me
